# Mingzat

The Mingzat font supports the Lepcha script. This is currently a work-in-progress, so these fonts and related files are preliminary and incomplete. They should not be used for creating derivatives until a later release.


## Project status [![Build Status](http://build.palaso.org/app/rest/builds/buildType:Fonts_Mingzat/statusIcon)](http://build.palaso.org/viewType.html?buildTypeId=Fonts_Mingzat&guest=1)  


Mingzat is based on Jason Glavy's JG Lepcha font which was a custom-encoded font. We have used his design with his generous permission. He also agreed to allow the font to be released under the SIL Open Font License (OFL).
