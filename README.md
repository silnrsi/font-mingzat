Mingzat v1.100 has been released. 

Mingzat is based on Jason Glavy's JG Lepcha font which was a custom-encoded font. We have used his design with his generous permission. He also agreed to allow the font to be released under the SIL Open Font License (OFL). 

This font has both OpenType and Graphite support.
