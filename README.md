# Mingzat

The Mingzat font supports the Lepcha script. This is currently a work-in-progress, so these fonts and related files are preliminary and incomplete. They should not be used for creating derivatives until a later release.

Mingzat is based on Jason Glavy's JG Lepcha font which was a custom-encoded font. We have used his design with his generous permission. He also agreed to allow the font to be released under the SIL Open Font License (OFL). 

For copyright and licensing information - including any Reserved Font Names - see [OFL.txt](OFL.txt).

For practical information about using, modifying and redistributing this font see [OFL-FAQ.txt](OFL-FAQ.txt).

For more details about this project, including changelog and acknowledgements see [FONTLOG.txt](FONTLOG.txt) and [README.txt](README.txt).
