			Mingzat is based on Jason Glavy's JG Lepcha font which was a custom-encoded
font. We have used his design with his generous permission. He also agreed 
to allow the font to be released under the SIL Open Font License (OFL). 

The goal for this product was to provide a single Unicode-based font 
that would contain all Lepcha characters. In addition, there is provision 
for other Latin characters and symbols. This font makes use of 
state-of-the-art font technologies (Graphite and OpenType) to support the 
need for conjuncts and to position arbitrary combinations of Lepcha glyphs 
and combining marks optimally. 

One font from this typeface family is included in this release:

     * Mingzat Regular

      SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
      -----------------------------------------------------------
      
      PREAMBLE
      The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
      development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
      efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
      open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
      with others.
      
      The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
      redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
      fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 
      redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
      names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
      however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
      requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
      to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
